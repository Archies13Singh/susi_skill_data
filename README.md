# susi_skill_data
This is the storage place for susi skills. It is for now a temporary solution for a wiki-like skill editing service that we want to create in the near future.

## Installation

The production platform of http://susi.ai will do a `git pull origin master` every minute. That means, every change will be available very soon.
